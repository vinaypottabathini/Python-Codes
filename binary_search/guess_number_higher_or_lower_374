We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.



Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
1 <= pick <= n





##### Solution #########

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

import random

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        t, e, pick = 1, n, n
        while True:
            if t<e:
                pick = random.randrange(t, e)
                g = guess(pick)
                # print(pick, 'pick', t, 't', e, 'e', 'g', g)

                if g == -1:
                    e = pick-1 
                elif g == 1:
                    t=pick+1
                else:
                    return pick
            elif t==e:
                return t
